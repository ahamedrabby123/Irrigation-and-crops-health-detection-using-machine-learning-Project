# Irrigation and Crop Health Prediction using mechine learning 

 Overview
This project utilizes metadata-based approaches to predict optimal irrigation schedules and assess crop health. By analyzing structured metadata from various sources, the model provides actionable insights for farmers to optimize water usage and ensure healthy crop growth.

## Features
-Metadata-Driven Predictions:** Utilizes structured metadata from sensors, historical data, and external sources.
- Irrigation Optimization:** Determines the ideal amount of water required based on metadata attributes.
- Crop Health Monitoring:** Analyzes metadata from images, soil conditions, and weather patterns.
- Machine Learning Models:** Implements regression and classification algorithms using metadata features.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language:** Python
- Libraries:**
  - Pandas, NumPy (Metadata Processing)
  - Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
  - Flas (Web Application for Predictions)


## Data Sources
- Metadata from soil sensors (Moisture, temperature, humidity, pH level, etc.)
- Public metadata datasets related to soil and crop health



## Usage
Train the model using metadata:
  python train_model.py
  ```
Make predictions based on metadata:
  ```bash
  python predict.py --input data/sample_metadata.csv
  ```
-Deploy Web App:**
  ```bash
  flask run
  ```

## Model Performance
The project evaluates model performance using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for metadata-driven regression models
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score for metadata classification models
- Confusion Matrix for metadata-based crop health detection

## Future Enhancements
- Enhance metadata collection methods for better accuracy
- Implement real-time metadata-driven alerts and notifications for farmers
- Expand metadata sources with more diverse crop types and regions
- Integrate AI-driven recommendations using metadata analysis for fertilizer and pesticide use
